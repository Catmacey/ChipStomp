ChipStomp Guitar Effects Pedal
==============================

This is a digital guitar effects pedal based on the Arduino compatible Chipkit DP32 platform.
The project is a merging of a ChipKit DP32 with an Open Music Labs Stompshield in a custom build PCB.

The Chipkit is an arduino compatible platform powered by a 32bit Microchip PIC processor running at 40Mhz with 32Kb RAM and 128Kb flash.  The project is relativly simple in that it limits itself to using the PIC's internal RAM, built in 10bit ADC and utilizes two 8bit PWMs to form a single 16bit output.

First up is the Eagle CAD project files.
To follow is the compelete source code.
