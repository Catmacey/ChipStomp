ChipStomp
=====================

This is a digital guitar effects pedal based on the Arduino compatible Chipkit DP32 platform.
The project is a merging of a ChipKit DP32 and an Open Music Labs Stompshield.

The Chipkit is and arduino compatible platform powered by a 32bit Microchip PIC processor running at 40Mhz with 32Kb RAM and 128Kb flash.  The project is relativly simple using the PIC's built in 10bit ADC and utilizing two 8bit PWM outputs to form a single 16bit output.

First up is the Eagle CAD project files.
To follow is the compelete source code.
